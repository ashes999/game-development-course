# The Ultimate Game Development Resources List

I got fed up of trying to keep links of really awesome resources in a place that I could search/sort/catalog them. So I present them to you, here.

They are roughly ordered *chronologically*, in the order that you would *need* them.

# Tools
- [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/): Excellent, free image editor, oft-quoted as a free substitute for Photoshop.

# Pre-Development
You have an idea; now make it more concrete.

Note: **Please respect copyright.** Don't use other peoples intellectual property, especially in commercial games, without their prior permission. For quick concept art, it may suffice. Some sites, like Getty Images, prohibit use even for concept imagery beyond 60 days. Consult with a lawyer.

- [Google Image Search](http://images.google.com/): Awesome way to find good images, but not very specific ones.
- [Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.ca): Awesome way to find very specific images; important search words are "nobody" and "single object only".

# In Development
Used when you're now actually working on your game.

- [BFXR](http://www.bfxr.net/): quickly create decent sound-effects for your game.
- [FreeSound.org](http://freesound.org): download sounds toand compose awesome background ambiance.
- [The League of Movable Type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/): An awesome, but small, list of free-for-use fonts.
