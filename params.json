{"name":"Game-development-resources","tagline":"","body":"# The Ultimate Game Development Course (Outline)\r\n\r\nGame development is awesome. There are lots of things to read and know, best practices, great tools, and other useful \"stuff.\" This page attempts to give you a bare-bones \"course\" which takes you from initial idea through to implementation.\r\n\r\nSections are ordered *chronologically*, in the order that you would *need* them.\r\n\r\nReady? Here we go.\r\n\r\n# Essential Tools\r\n\r\nThese tools cross boundaries across platforms. Learn them well; you will use them extensively.\r\n\r\n- [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/): possibly the best free audio editor around. Also works as a convenient converter between MP3/WAV/OGG files.\r\n- [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/): Excellent, free image editor, oft-quoted as a free substitute for Photoshop.\r\n- [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/): an excellent and versatile 2D map editor for tiled maps. Usable enough for art; functional enough to create production game maps.\r\n\r\n# Core Mechanic\r\n\r\nGreat games start with a great core mechanic, the \"thing\" you do over and over again. In Tetris, you rotate and place blocks as they fall. In Mario, you run and jump to the end.\r\n\r\nGet your core mechanic right, because it makes or breaks your game.\r\n\r\n# Concept Art\r\n\r\nYou have an idea; now make it more real and vivid through concept art. This will help you flesh out parts of your idea; more importantly, it will **keep you motivated** through the long, thankless job of *shipping that idea.*\r\n\r\nCreate concept art that illustrates the major points of your game and motivates you to get it done.\r\n\r\nNote: **Please respect copyright.** Don't use other peoples intellectual property, especially in commercial games, without their prior permission. For quick concept art, it may suffice. Some sites, like Getty Images, prohibit use even for concept imagery beyond 60 days. Consult with a lawyer.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Also take a look at the resources under Main Development.\r\n\r\n- [Google Image Search](http://images.google.com/): Awesome way to find good images, but not very specific ones.\r\n- [Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.ca): Awesome way to find very specific images; important search words are \"nobody\" and \"single object only\".\r\n\r\n\r\n# Early Development\r\n\r\nYour idea is ready; you have the main gameplay fleshed out. Create the smallest possible prototype version of your code that you can imagine.\r\n\r\nIs your core mechanic great? Chances are it needs work. This is the time to tweak it and change it. If it's fun with placeholder graphics and no sound, it'll be amazing with the full, final production.\r\n\r\n# Main Development\r\n\r\nYou verified your idea by making it into reality, and saw that it works, and works well. Now grind that thing out to completion. Games are not just core gameplay, but they include art, sounds, screens, and many things that you need to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [BFXR](http://www.bfxr.net/): quickly create decent sound-effects for your game.\r\n- [CG Textures](http://www.cgtextures.com/): Free, quality textures for 3D (and other) work.\r\n- [Chibi Maker](http://www.famitsu.com/freegame/tool/chibi/index1.html): Character generator for \"chibi\" style characters (like in RPG Maker). Site is in Japanese, but still usable without understanding the language.\r\n- [Face Generator](http://foxrichards.deviantart.com/art/FaceMaker-52755515): Generates 2D faces from a pre-defined set of features. Useful for character avatars.\r\n- [FreeSound.org](http://freesound.org): download sounds toand compose awesome background ambiance.\r\n- [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/): beautiful collection of fonts, 100% free for commercial use.\r\n- [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts): Excellent collection of fonts with very permissive licensing/terms of usage. Yes, you can download the fonts too.\r\n- [IconFinder](https://www.iconfinder.com/): Great way to find small, free (and paid) icons that you can use in your games.\r\n- [Public Art](https://github.com/ummah/public-game-art): A repository of RPG-Maker-like 2D top-down tiles, characters, and related artwork. Take a look (especially if you're making 2D top-down perspective games).\r\n- [The League of Movable Type](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/): An awesome, but small, list of free-for-use fonts.\r\n\r\n# Finishing Touches\r\nYour game is pretty much done. There's still a lot of stuff you can do to make it better -- smaller, faster, etc.\r\n\r\n- [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/): Compresses all your PNGs in a loss-less way. Saves tons of bytes.\r\n\r\n# Pre-Release\r\nFinally, your game is complete! You need to prepare it for your marketing push.\r\n\r\n- [6 Simple Things You can do to Improve Your Screenshots](http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/6-simple-things-you-can-do-to-improve-your-screenshots--gamedev-14272): useful for marketing materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Android Games\r\n- Integrate [Flurry Analytics](http://www.flurry.com/solutions/analytics) so you can track errors in your game. Place key events so you can monitor for potential problems (eg. level too difficult)\r\n- Read the Google Play requirements. Create at least:\r\n    - Two high-resolution screenshots (eg. `1280x800`)\r\n    - High-res app icon (512x512)\r\n    - Promo graphic (180x120)\r\n    - Featured graphic (1024x500)\r\n- Make it work on OUYA.\r\n    - [Here are some notes](http://forums.ouya.tv/discussion/1174/porting-from-mobile-to-ouya/p1) on how to do that.\r\n    - [Fix your dead zones](http://www.third-helix.com/2013/04/doing-thumbstick-dead-zones-right/) and [make them radial](https://gist.github.com/stfx/5372176)\r\n\r\n# Marketing\r\n\r\n- **Android Games:** Post on Google Play and [SlideMe](http://slideme.org/).\r\n- **OUYA Games:** Market on [the official forums](http://forums.ouya.tv/categories/games) and on [these forums](http://ouyaforum.com/forum.php) \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
