<p>Game development is awesome. There are lots of things to read and know, best practices, great tools, and other useful "stuff." This page attempts to give you a bare-bones "course" which takes you from initial idea through to implementation.</p>

<p>Sections are ordered <em>chronologically</em>, in the order that you would <em>need</em> them.</p>

<a id="core-mechanic-prototyping" class="anchor" href="#core-mechanic-prototyping" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Core Mechanic Prototyping</h1>

<p>Great games start with a great core mechanic, the "thing" you do over and over again. In Tetris, you rotate and place blocks as they fall. In Mario, you run and jump to the end.</p>

<p>Get your core mechanic right, because it makes or breaks your game. When you take away the graphics, audio, achievements, etc. what you have left is your real core game. That's your mechanic, that  players play over and over again.</p>

<p>Prototype aggressively, and use extensive user testing to figure out what works and what doesn't. You're writing throw-away code.</p>

<p><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/deengames/development/prototyping">Here's my step by step methodology</a>.</p>

<p>These links are also good reads:</p>

</ul>

<p>Once you have a proven, fun, grey-boxed core set of mechanics for your game, move on.</p>

<a id="main-development" class="anchor" href="#main-development" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Main Development</h1>

<p>You modified and verified your idea by making it into reality, and saw that it works, and works well. Now grind that thing out to completion. Games are not just core gameplay, but they include art, sounds, screens, and many things that you need to do.</p>

<p>You may want to completely rewrite your game in a different technology to make it production-ready (eg. something more cross-platform/solid/fast/low-level/etc.), or you may want to heavily modify your existing code to bring it up to standards. </p>
