<p>Game development is awesome. There are lots of things to read and know, best practices, great tools, and other useful "stuff." This page attempts to give you a bare-bones "course" which takes you from initial idea through to implementation.</p>

<p>Sections are ordered <em>chronologically</em>, in the order that you would <em>need</em> them.</p>

<p>Ready? Here we go.</p>

<h1>
<a name="essential-tools" class="anchor" href="#essential-tools"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Essential Tools</h1>

<p>These tools cross boundaries across platforms. Learn them well; you will use them extensively.</p>

<ul>
<li>

<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>: Excellent, free image editor, oft-quoted as a free substitute for Photoshop.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled Map Editor</a>: an excellent and versatile 2D map editor for tiled maps. Usable enough for concept or prototype art; functional enough to create production game maps.</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="essential-theory" class="anchor" href="#essential-theory"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Essential "Theory"</h1>

<p>Game design is a field which is increasingly attracting smart analysis; there are some good ideas about how to design better games.</p>

<p>Read as much of the below links as you can; they all talk about fundamental underpinnings in games (eg. what is "good" vs. "bad" difficulty in games).</p>

<a name="core-mechanic" class="anchor" href="#core-mechanic"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Core Mechanic</h1>

<p>Great games start with a great core mechanic, the "thing" you do over and over again. In Tetris, you rotate and place blocks as they fall. In Mario, you run and jump to the end.</p>

<p>Get your core mechanic right, because it makes or breaks your game. When you take away the graphics, audio, achievements, etc. what you have left is your real core game. That's your mechanic, that  players play over and over again.</p>

<p>Once you have a decent idea of how your game works, move to the next section.</p>

<h1>
<a name="concept-art" class="anchor" href="#concept-art"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Concept Art</h1>

<p>You have an idea; now make it more real and vivid through concept art. This will help you flesh out parts of your idea; more importantly, it will <strong>keep you motivated</strong> through the long, thankless job of <em>shipping that idea.</em></p>

<p>Create concept art that illustrates the major points of your game and motivates you to get it done.</p>

<p>Note: <strong>Please respect copyright.</strong> Don't use other peoples intellectual property, especially in commercial games, without their prior permission. For quick concept art, it may suffice. Some sites, like Getty Images, prohibit use even for concept imagery beyond 60 days. Consult with a lawyer.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Also take a look at the resources under Main Development.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://images.google.com/">Google Image Search</a>: Awesome way to find good images, but not very specific ones.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.gettyimages.ca">Getty Images</a>: Awesome way to find very specific images; important search words are "nobody" and "single object only".</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="early-development--prototyping" class="anchor" href="#early-development--prototyping"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Early Development / Prototyping</h1>

<p>Your idea is ready; you have major points of the main gameplay fleshed out, complete with some inspirational art. Create the smallest possible prototype version of your code that you can imagine.</p>

<p>Is your core mechanic great? Chances are it needs work. This is the time to tweak it and change it. If it's fun with placeholder graphics and no sound, it'll be amazing with the full, final production.</p>

<p>The goal here is to <strong>trade quality for speed.</strong> The quicker you make your game, the faster you can tell if it's awesome, or less so. Don't worry about code quality, unit testing, or any of that other stuff; just make sure you have something playable and it's <em>fun.</em></p>

<p>Some technologies which are useful for fast/cheap prototyping:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://craftyjs.com/">CraftyJS</a>: Javascript game library with entity/component architecture and event-based messaging. You can create reusable components and parameterized entities, and game development is quite fast. You can also evolve/rewrite your code into production code (complete with unit testing) if you decide to stick with this platform.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a>: Lua game development library. Many swear by it.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.libgosu.org/">Gosu</a>: Ruby/desktop game dev library; also has unofficial Android port.</li>
</ul><h1>
<a name="main-development" class="anchor" href="#main-development"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Main Development</h1>

<p>You modified and verified your idea by making it into reality, and saw that it works, and works well. Now grind that thing out to completion. Games are not just core gameplay, but they include art, sounds, screens, and many things that you need to do.</p>

<p>You may want to completely rewrite your game in a different technology to make it production-ready (eg. something more cross-platform/solid/fast/low-level/etc.), or you may want to heavily modify your existing code to bring it up to standards. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.bfxr.net/">BFXR</a>: quickly create decent sound-effects for your game.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cgtextures.com/">CG Textures</a>: Free, quality textures for 3D (and other) work.</li>
